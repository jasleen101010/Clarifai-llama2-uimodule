# LLAMA2 UI Module Assignment 

This is a repository to make it easy to get started creating a UI module for LLAMA2 with Clarifai.


## To use this repo

1. Clone the new repo as normal to your development environment.
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt` to make sure you have all the Python packages installed. 
3. Rename the pages/*.py files as you desire and start filling them in to implement your module if needed. ( I have not used this in my UI Module for LLAMA2.)
4. After you're tried things out locally, push your changes to github and get the git commit URL from there in order to create a module in Clarifai. 
5. Go to any app you can create in within Clarifai, select Modules on the left and "Create Module" button, then follow the steps.
